# Challenge

Run the file main.py to build and launch the API.

The requirements are specified in the file requirements.txt

To use the api, send POST requests on the /productionplan endpoint, containing the payload.

The api will return a json response.

You can use the file testing.py to try the api with examples of payload.

To calculate the unit-commitment, I used the Simplex algorithm. I took the code from a tutorial and adapt it to the case. Source tutorial: https://medium.com/@jacob.d.moore1/coding-the-simplex-algorithm-from-scratch-using-python-and-numpy-93e3813e6e70
